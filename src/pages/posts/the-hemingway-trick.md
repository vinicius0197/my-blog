The first step is always the hardest, as the saying goes. That is true for life and also for writing books. Ernest Hemingway is quoted as saying that “when you are going good, stop writing.” I know that this may sound counterintuitive, but the idea is that knowing when to stop working is an important part of being productive on the long haul.

I think that starting to work on something takes a lot of willpower, and the more barriers there are for you to start working, the more likely you are to procrastinate. In the case of Ernest Hemingway, that could be something like starting a new chapter on his book from scratch first thing in the morning. That surely does take a lot of willpower.

But if he had stopped writing mid-chapter (or mid-phrase) the day before, he would have way fewer barriers to overcome the next day. He would start working right away knowing exactly that to work on, and from there. And from there, maybe starting the next chapter wouldn't seem like such a daunting task.

I've heard about this quote from Hemingway a few weeks ago and started to think about how I could apply this to my own work as a developer. I'm not writing any novels, that's for sure, but I do write code on a daily basis, and most times starting the day with a huge and complicated task in front of me is really discouraging.

For me, at least, most of this discouragement comes from the fact that the task itself is really big, complicated and hard to reason about. It's easy to fall into the trap of procrastinating or doing work that's easier (but less important) instead of tackling the real problems.

Starting the day with a simple, direct task is way easier. So instead of solving all the problems the day before, you make your future-you life easier by leaving some work unfinished that you can tackle the next day. Working on this unfinished code will be a gentle way to get yourself back into the flow. And at the end of the day, you do the same thing. You leave some work unfinished.

That's not a hard rule, of course. Sometimes you will want (or need) to actually finish all your work. But I think that this trick is more about learning to be productive not on sporadic surges of willpower, but on a really consistent basis. You finish each day of work by carefully choosing what you will leave unfinished to tackle the next day.

Instead of riding that dopamine wave by doing all the work now (because you're in the flow and really productive) while trusting that you feel as motivated the next day, you delay the gratification of finishing something that you know how to do so that you can be consistent. That's hard to do, but it really works.

It's a very simple idea, but one that I really like.

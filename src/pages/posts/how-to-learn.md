Learning new things is important, as we all know. Learning new things is also difficult. It takes time and effort and is oftentimes stressful. If you aren't particularly excited about the topic at hand, it can be even more so.

Thinking back to my own studies for the past few years, I can remember countless times when learning was a chore. And mind you, I actually enjoy learning. Those struggles probably reflect more my own lack of a proper study method than any inherent difficulty of the subject itself. I would procrastinate and not be very efficient, which means that when exams came, I would get stressed out while cramming late nights.

Not a good situation.

And this isn't just for college students. I believe that learning *how to learn* is one of the most important skills anyone could cultivate in their personal and professional lives.

The benefits of being a good learner are obvious, but I could break down the main one into: **a)** being efficient in your learning **b)** minimizing stress and **c)** enjoying the process a little bit more.

Yes, I do believe you can find some joy in your own learning. People think that they can only get good on things they enjoy doing when the opposite is just as likely: you can start enjoying things when you get good at them.

Okay, you say, I get it. But how do I learn the right way? What am I doing wrong?

So, I've recently read Barbara Oakley's *A Mind for Numbers* after a friend suggested it to me. You may have heard about this book already. In a nutshell, it's a guide focused on teaching people (mainly college students) the basic principles for studying subjects like math and science. The advice given in the book is pretty universal, actually, and you could easily apply it to other fields of study. I made some notes while reading it and decided to compile the main ideas of the book in a guide that I could refer back to in the future. This is that guide. I hope you find it useful as well.

None of those tips and ideas will be groundbreaking stuff. You may have heard about them already. You may have even used some of them without thinking about it. But I think that the main value from the book is how it presents a structured, battle-tested way to learn. If you have the opportunity, I recommend you read it.

Otherwise, here's the quick and straight to the point version.

**Table of Contents:**

### Focused mode and diffuse mode <a name="focused-and-diffuse-mode"></a>

A big part of the book is on discussing the differences between focused and diffuse work. The focused mode is the direct approach of solving a problem, a.k.a doing the hard work. The diffuse mode is more subtle. It's what allows you to see the big-picture and gain new insights.

Most of us know what focused work is. We have done that already. But you've probably also had experiences with diffuse mode insights. When after tirelessly trying to solve a difficult math problem for two hours you have an 'aha' moment while jogging down the park, or a solution to some bug in your code pops up in your head when you are bathing. Thing is: your brain continue working on your problems even when you aren't aware of it, and by doing so, it allows you to solve problems in novel, more creative ways.

That's important because of something called the *Einstellung Effect*. You've probably experienced this already: you think about a way of solving a problem and then you are stuck with that way of thinking and can't direct your thought to better solutions. You keep trying to solve the problem the same way, even if it's wrong.

The main takeaway from this is that you need to allow yourself to cool down, relax and take a break. As the author puts it:

> Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires one or more periods when you aren't consciously working on the problem.

### Use recall <a name="use-recall"></a>

Many people study just by reading the material. You read your textbook and take notes on stuff you think is important. Maybe when exams are approaching you re-read your own notes again and run your eyes over the text one more time just to be sure you are not forgetting anything important.

The author advocates that this is a terrible way to study. That may be shocking to you, but there's thing called *Illusion of Competence* (lots of fancy terms, I know). By just reading the material your mind tricks you into thinking you've already absorbed it. Seeing it written down on paper creates the illusion that that piece of knowledge is already in your brain.

That's why the author suggests that you use *recall* instead of just plain reading. It's actually very simple and a lot of people do this (many without even realizing it). Instead of passively reading new material, you formulate questions based on it that you can inquire yourself on later.

As an example, if you are studying math and come across the definition of a binary relation, you can try to write down a question such as: What is the definition of a binary relation? And the next time you study you try to recall what it is. Recalling here is key. It allows no illusions. If you don't really know it, you can't fake it. It's also highly effective because you are always testing yourself on whether or not you've already nailed the material.

Constantly testing yourself, by using recall practice, is one of the most effective ways to study.

There are a lot of ways of approaching the recall method: you can try flashcards or use Anki (I will talk more about Anki later in this post). Ali Abdaal has a bunch of cool tips on his YouTube channel on the recall practice. I think [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHJzSbLiQNs%5D) is really useful if you are just getting started with this.

### Using spaced repetition <a name="spaced-repetition"></a>

I really like this one. I was familiar with the idea of spaced repetition already but never tried to implement it before reading the book.
This is one of the fundamental ideas of the software **Anki** (together with recall practice). 

Basically, you try to space your study at increasingly larger periods. If you learned something new today, you review it tomorrow. Then
again after 3 days, and 7 days, and so on...

Why? You may ask. Because there's this thing called a forgetting curve:

![forgetting curve](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/ForgettingCurve.svg)

This curve represents how information in your brain is forgotten over time if there's no attempt whatsoever to retain it. Spaced repetition tries to fix that. By remembering stuff at just the point you are almost forgetting it, you strengthen your memory and make that piece of information more accessible in the long run.

Again, Anki is an excellent way to use this concept in practice. As previously hinted, Anki is just a collection of a bunch of (digital) flashcards and an algorithm to calculate, based on your previous attempts at recalling the content of each card, when to show it again to you. The algorithm is built in such a way that difficult topics (the ones you get wrong frequently) will be shown to you regularly, while
information what is rock solid will appear sparingly.

You don't actually need Anki (or any similar software) to practice using spaced repetition. You can keep track of the days you need to
review some topic by yourself. But having the practicality of the algorithm doing that work for you surely helps.

### Creating conceptual chunks <a name="conceptual-chunks"></a>

What's the best way of solving a puzzle?

![Puzzle](https://i.imgur.com/PYFH7fQ.jpg)

I would say that there are two main components to this: understanding the big-picture (the image you're trying to form) and also how the smaller pieces fit together with eacher other.

If you only use the big-picture approach you won't be able to solve it. You just know what it is supposed to look like when it's done.

If you just focus on how the small pieces fit together, you are going to have a hard time figuring out what the puzzle is supposed to represent. Things start to get disconnected and you don't know what you are trying to achieve.

Problem-solving is just like solving a puzzle. If you try to understand any topic, you need to attack it from both angles: bottom-up and top-down.

Top-down gives you the big-picture: what's this all about? Why it's important? Where will it be used? How those concepts are related to one another? It's about *when* to use a technique.

Bottom-up gives you the practical ways of using the knowledge and makes sure you will have access to it when needed. It's about *how* to use a certain technique.

Chunking is the process of breaking down concepts into smaller pieces that you can later use to solve problems. You start by getting a good overview on the subject (that's the big picture or top-down approach) and then proceed to break it down into smaller pieces that you can fully compreheend.

The idea of forming a conceptual chunk is the following:

1. First, you try to get some overview of the topic you are studying. Briefly reading a new chapter in your textbook before attempting to delve deep into it is a good way to start. This is a top-down approach.
2. Now it's time to chunk that chapter into useful pieces of knowledge. Read again, but now focusing your attention on some specific piece of information you want to chunk.
3. Understand the basic idea of what you want to chunk.
4. Gain context: when to use the chunk and when NOT to

This is very much like the analogy of a puzzle I presented earlier. When you approach a new topic from a top-down approach, you're trying to get a general feeling for how things fit together to form a whole. When you go from a bottom-up perspective, you are trying to understand what each individual piece means and how to use it.

In the book, the author proposes a checklist for creating powerful, long-term chunks of knowledge. Its main focus is on learning subjects like math and science, but you can tweak it and try to apply the same concept for other areas of learning:

1. Work a key problem all the way through (on paper!). A key problem tests for a lot of conceptual ideas that you are trying to understand
2. Now, do another repetition of the problem, focusing on the hard parts: the bits where you struggled.
3. The fun part: take a break. Go to sleep or do something else entirely.
4. Repeat the problem again another time.
5. Do the same with some other (key) problem
6. Remember to review those key problems steps. Recall practice is a good way to do this.

If this looks too time-consuming, focus on doing that just on most important problems.

For the last point, reviewing problems you've already solved, I would recommend (again) using Anki. Create a card with the problem description as the question and provide an answer (maybe just photograph the solution you did on paper). For a given problem, I would try to remember which were the key steps of the solution: the ideas that were relevant and in which order I applied them.

### Procrastination <a name="procrastination"></a>

There are a lot of resources on beating procrastination. In the end, it all comes down to having the discipline to accept a little bit of discomfort right now, and there are no shortcuts around it. But I think that there are some general tips that helped me, and maybe could benefit others as well.

There's this quote I read in a [blog post](https://jamesclear.com/plan-for-chaos) by James Clear that I found very useful and practical:

> Reduce the scope, stick to the schedule

The idea is very simple: turn what you are trying to do in a process. A routine you do each day, preferably in the same place and at the same time. And now try committing yourself to doing it every day, reducing the scope only if needed.

Don't feel motivated enough to go through a 2-hour long study session? Do it for just 25 minutes, but try to not skip a single day. Being able to make progress every day, even if it's small, is what enables you to be successful in the long run.

Which brings us to the next topic...

### Focusing on the process <a name="focusing-on-process"></a>

If you are learning something, you probably have some kind of outcome in mind. Be it passing an exam, being able to speak fluently in some foreign language or acquiring some new skill to help you land a good job. Those are all valid possible outcomes for learning something new.

But day to day, it's way easier to focus on just following a routine, some kind of process that you establish for yourself and can easily follow. A lot of people can cram for an exam 8 hours straight the night before a test. You may pass the exam, you may even get good grades, but it's just not sustainable.

The key idea is having a simple routine and not going overboard with it. Half an hour of solid, focused study each day is way more productive than long study sessions the day before an exam. Remember the diffuse mode we've discussed? That's where it comes into play. Having the time between study sessions to let your brain relax is crucial to learning.

A good tip is just scheduling a half an hour block each day for your learning. Decide beforehand what you are going to study, and when then time comes, allowing yourself to simply follow the process.

### Memorization <a name="memorization"></a>

I think that this one can be a little bit controversial. For some people, it may seem trivial to memorize material when everything that you could possibly want to know is like 3 clicks away.

I don't believe in memorizing every small detail of the material you are studying, or even worse, memorizing stuff you don't actually understand.

But memorizing stuff about material that you *do* understand and have internalized can really deepen your knowledge. In a way, it's part of the chunking process that we've talked about earlier.

For memorizing things, I think the best approach is by using spaced-repetition with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net). I've already hinted at it previously, but now let's introduce it properly. I know it's kinda ugly, but it simply works and is very simple to understand. Anki is basically a way to automate all this process of active recall and spaced repetition we've been talking about and it has become a central part of my study flow. I will simply jot notes directly into it by creating new cards for the subject I'm studying.

There are a lot of resources on using Anki on the internet. I really recommend it.

### Make things simple <a name="make-things-simple"></a>

There's this thing called the Feynman Method, named after famous physicist Richard Feynman. It's a very simple mental method, and can be fully explained by looking at the following flowchart:

![Feynman Method Chart](https://i.imgur.com/3DEO2vl.jpg)

The beauty of the Feynman Method is that it doesn't allow us to hide our weak points. When we try to explain something that we don't fully comprehend, we usually gloss over the more difficult parts in a hand-wavy way. Whenever you notice yourself doing this, stop, identify where the gaps in your knowledge are and try to simplify those enough sou you could (theoretically at least) teach it to a 6-years old toddler.

Better yet, for my fellow programmers, is to combine this method with the famous *rubber duck debugging technique*. For those who don't know, rubber duck debugging is the (kinda humorous, I guess) process of obtaining a rubber duck, placing it in your working desk and trying to explain to the poor thing, line by line, what your code is supposed to do. The idea is that, by trying to explain code in simpler terms, line by line, you eventually find out why it doesn't work as you expected it to.

The bottom line is: try to eliminate any gaps in your knowledge by putting everything you know in simple terms. If you are using unnecessarily difficult language to explain something, you probably don't understand it.

### Experiment with your own learning <a name="experiment"></a>

Experimenting with your own learning processes is key. All those steps and concepts described here are great general tools that you can apply, but in the end, it all comes down to what works for you.

How much time do you think it's feasible for you to devote to learning each day? Maybe your mind starts to get fatigued after a 1-hour study session and you don't retain much after that. Or maybe you are a beast who can read for 10 hours straight daily (and has the time to do so!). You may do your best work in the mornings or be a late-night owl. Only you know.

Some tips from the book that I've found helpful:

- Keep notes on when you don't complete your tasks. What you had intended to do? What are the cues that made you procrastinate and what were your reactions to those cues?
- Figure out which kind of environment best suits your learning
- Do the most important thing first in the morning.
- Transform distant deadlines into daily ones

The last one I've found very beneficial for myself. It's very easy to procrastinate on something that's due weeks or even months from now. The best way is to break those bigger milestones into smaller tasks that you can accomplish daily.

### Main takeaways

There's more stuff in the book than what I've described here, but I think those are the points that more resonated with me and that I've found more useful overall.

Using Anki has really been a game-changer for my own learning. It's really great because it encapsulates a lot of those tips in just one piece of software. It has recall practice and spaced repetition built-in, and you can be creative with it and use it for chunking pieces of knowledge.

Also, in the end, it all comes down to practicing the discipline of making process, even if it's just a little bit, every day.

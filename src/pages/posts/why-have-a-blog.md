I've been thinking about starting a blog for some time lately. I always would put it for later, though, mainly because I was busy working at other stuff. Also, I didn't know what I would blog about. I mean, there's a lot of software developers blogging out there about a bunch of stuff, so what's the point, right?

But starting a blog is a great exercise in teaching and learning stuff that I find beneficial, especially for developers (what probably explains the large numbers of software-related blogs). It's a way to document your learning process and thoughts. Also, you probably know that teaching something is the best way to know if you've actually learned it. It forces you to digest knowledge in a comprehensible way, and illustrate it into words so that others can learn as well (or maybe even yourself a few months or years in the future).

Since I've been learning a lot of cool stuff related to tech and coding lately, I thought that alone would be a cool reason to start blogging.
But another reason to start blogging, and it's related to the first one, is that it forces you to *communicate*. 

I believe that communication is a very important tool in the software developer's toolkit and one which is frequently overlooked. We, as a bunch of technical people, are usually more worried about getting into that new framework or programming language, building that cool project and getting into the nitty-gritty details of our craft as programmers. But communication is very important for working with teams of other developers, and written communication especially. We all know that written communication is making a huge comeback since we're all now constantly texting each other, and teams collaborating worldwide through remote work is commonplace nowadays.

Alexey Guzey actually wrote a very good blog post about this subject of starting a blog [right here](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) and reading it was one of the reasons I've started writing here.

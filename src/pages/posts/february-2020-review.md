This last month I've dedicated myself to learning React and Redux. All my last posts here reflect that. I had already used React on some projects before, but I was a little rusty and needed a refresh. Also, it looked like a good way to start learning Redux.

Also, I've finally made some adjustments to this blog layout (now it's mobile-friendly!) and bought a domain. I've rushed to launch this blog late January, and because of that, there are still a couple of things that need to get done. First of all, I need a Newsletter, and maybe some way to tag posts to separate them in categories.

Even if there's stuff missing right now, launching the blog right away and letting myself worry about details later has enabled me to start publishing posts quicker and prevented me to procrastinate. I know from experience that pursuing perfection is dangerous, and it's better to have something working right now so I can adjust it in the future.

Apart from that, last week I've also started a personal project to deepen my knowledge of React and Redux. The idea is to build a functioning Trello-clone, but I would like to include some features that I would like original Trello to have as well. To do that, I've been studying the [React Drag-and-Drop](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd) library. Finishing this project will be my main focus during March.

I've published a total of 3 blog posts during February, which is below my goal of at least one post per week.

So, my goals for this month are:

- Publish at least one blog post per week
- Complete a bare-minimum MVP of my side-project
- Create a newsletter for the blog
